Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (\"DNT\") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"s9\">\r\n9.
